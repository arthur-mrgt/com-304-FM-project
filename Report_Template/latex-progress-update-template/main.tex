% ---------- Milestone Progress ----------
\section{Milestone Progress}
Report here on the steps taken so far in implementing the project, including both a very brief summary of the notebooks and any other steps taken to prepare for implementation of the extensions if any.


% ---------- Discussion & Next Steps ----------
\section{Feasibility of Original Plan}
\label{sec:feasibility}
Reflect on whether you believe that your original plan for extensions as outlined in the Project Proposal is achievable or not, justifying this belief in terms of expected data needs, compute requirements, training costs etc. needed to achieve your original plan.


\section{Next Steps}
Provide an updated description of the extensions that you plan to implement, together with a more concrete explanation of how this plan will be achieved compared to the Project Proposal, referring to expected data needs, compute requirements, training costs etc. This should include a tentative but clear list of the action items you plan to work on until the final report and how they relate to the projectâ€™s overall goal. 

If you are continuing with your original plan, you can refer back to Section~\ref{sec:feasibility} for details that have already been discussed there.


% ---------- Author Contribution Statement ----------
\section{Author Contribution Statement}
\textit{Only for projects that have more than one author:}
List here how each author contributed in this milestone. This section will also be required in the final project submission. For an example on how to write an author contribution statement, have a look here: \url{https://www.epj.org/images/stories/faq/examples-of-author-contributions.pdf}
